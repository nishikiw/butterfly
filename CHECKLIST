A. PLEASE ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS (your assignment will not be 
   graded otherwise! Seriously, it won't be. At all.)
  
1. I verify that I completed this assignment according to the 
   UofT Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters found at
   http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm

   _X_Yes   ___No


2. I collaborated on this assignment with another student or borrowed 
   code from another source 

   ___Yes   _X__No

   If Yes, you must clearly note in your program which parts are 
   common/borrowed and which are yours, failure to do so will be 
   construed as plagiarism.).

   Properly noted code shared with someone else will receive a
   reduced mark, but will *not* be construed as plagiarism.

   If you checked yes, please supply:

   Student name/Source: 

______________________________________________________________________________

B. PLACE AN (X) IN THE CORRESPONDING PLACE. For any partially completed 
   code, please add a brief description of the corresponding item so 
   your TA can consider it for part marks.
   
Description/value									Completed							Partial	    			Not done	Mark

* Add controls for the
  variables that affect
  Boid motion:
  k_rule1, k_rule2, k_rule3,				X
  k_rule0, r_rule2, r_rule3
  and global rotation.
  (5 marks)

* Correctly implemented
  (working!) Boid update						X
  rule 1
  (5 marks)

* Correctly implemented
  (working) Boid update							X
  rule 2
  (5 marks)

* Correctly implemented
  (working) Boid update							X
  rule 3   
  (5 marks)

* Correctly implemented
  (working) Boid update							X
  rule 0 (Paco's rule)
  (5 marks)

* Correctly implemented
  Boid position update							X
  (5 marks)

* Completed boid drawing
  function with something
  that is not a simple							X
  sphere, single polygon,
  or GLUT primitive shape.
  (5 marks)

* (TA assigned): Up to 5
  marks for the REPORT

* (TA assigned): Up to 5
  marks for 'artistic merit'

* (TA assigned): -5 to +5
  marks for coding style
  Negative marks are
  'earned' by messy, confusing,
  undocumented code.

Total before Crunchy (T):

C. ADD A SINGLE BULLET (*) FOR EACH CRUNCHY FEATURE ADDED, so your TA
   can give extra credit for your extensions. Unlisted features will not
   be graded!

Feature																							Extra credit

* Add a 'shapeness' component.
  this should give your Boids a tendency
  to hover near one of the points of a
  3D model imported from file.
  
* Make the updates smoother: instead
  of having hard thresholds on distances for
  the update computations (r_rule1, r_rule2,
  r_rule3), use a weighted computation
  where contributions are weighted by
  distance and the weight decays as a
  function of the corresponding r_rule
  parameter.

* Add a few 'predatory boids'. Select
  a couple of boids randomly. These become
  predators and the rest of the boids
  should have a strong tendency to
  avoid them. The predatory boids should
  follow the standard rules.
  
* Animate boids: You can draw your boids
  differently on each frame to provide
  animation. For example, birds may flap
  their wings as they move, fish may
  move their fins. Do something appropriate
  that looks good for extra credit.

(add more * if needed)
